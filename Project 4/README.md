# Twoogle - Cross Lingual Information Retrieval System

The project deals with collection of tweets pertaining to a topic in various languages and the tweets were translated into various languages using Microsoft Translate API. These tweets were ingested to Apache Solr for indexing. The results are returned in various languages upon querying. Various filtering options were also added to the UI.
